Blockchain Hash Management System for Image Integrity

This is a group project that implements a blockchain management system for storing image hashes, supporting two hashing algorithms: SHA-256 and Blake2. It consists of a REST API that allows the following operations:
  Adding blocks to the blockchain.
  Verifying the integrity of blocks.
  Searching for image hashes within the blockchain.
  Retrieving information about the blockchain.
Block data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
